        <p>
            Hey, I am Sam, I am certified for CPR and to teach Cycling, I have not hiccupped since the eighth grade, and one might say I have a passion for passions. My greatest realms of passions probably have to do with movement, I love anything movement being running, swimming, cycling, and just about any sport. Another true love of mine is anything you can do in the grand outdoors, some top picks include canoeing, backpacking, and gardening. Along with my passions I have a plethora of goals some being to make a perfect chicken gnocchi soup, have a blueberry orchard, record a full audio Bible, and hike the Appalachian trail.
